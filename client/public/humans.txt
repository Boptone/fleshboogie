/* PHILOSOPHY */
FLESHBOOGIE is a music and culture news aggregator built on the principle of curation over algorithm.
We believe in surfacing underground voices, independent artists, and cultural movements that deserve attention.
No celebrity gossip. No politics. No violence. Just pure music, film, art, and culture.
